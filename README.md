Built with Tauri and React, it uses multi-threaded connections to speed up your downloads while keeping everything organized in a clean, distraction-free interface. No bloat, no unnecessary features—just fast, reliable downloads.

- **Complete history** – Never lose track of what you've downloaded
- **Drag & drop** – Just drop a URL or file to start downloading
- **Flexible settings** – Customize download locations, thread counts, and more
